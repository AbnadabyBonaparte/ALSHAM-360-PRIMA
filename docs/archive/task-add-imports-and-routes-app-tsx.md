# Task Archive: Add imports and routes in App.tsx

- **Status:** Archived
- **Reason:** All planned changes were merged in PR #54 (Fix Content Security Policy violations).
- **Notes:** No further action required because App.tsx and routes/index.tsx already contain the imports, route registry updates, and CSP fixes delivered by the earlier task.
